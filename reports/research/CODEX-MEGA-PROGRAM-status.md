# CODEX MEGA-PROGRAM — living status (resume anchor)

**Program:** `docs/CODEX-MEGA-PROGRAM-x64-engine-to-real-games-6month.md`
**Rule:** at the START of every run, read this file, resume the FIRST phase not marked DONE, and
chain forward through all remaining phases without stopping for approval (see AUTONOMY section of
the program). Update this file as each gate is passed. **NEXT** below is always the resume point.

---

## NEXT → Phase 1 (x86_64 ISA completeness & correctness). START HERE.
Begin immediately. Do not wait for approval. Work through Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 continuously;
only escalate on a true hard blocker / direction decision / milestone-regression risk.

## Phase ledger

### Phase 0 — close out residual fault — ✅ DONE (2026-05-30, verified)
- Fix: TLS-aware normalization of x64 callback targets in
  `engine/wine/dlls/ntdll/unix/macrunner_hb.c` (`macrunner_hb_dispatch_x64_callback`) +
  `signal_arm64.c` fallback. Reads `AddressOfCallBacks` from the AMD64 TLS dir, snaps near-padding
  PCs (0x14000150f → 0x140001510) to the real callback entry.
- Evidence (operator-verified): `reports/arm64ec-phase0-run-hello_x64-20260530-143933.log` →
  `hello from windows pe`, `run_exit=0`, `cleanup_exit=0`, ZERO runtime-fail/MEMORY_FAULT/c000007b;
  `stdout_stderr_x64` same. Trace: original=0x14000150f → target=0x140001510.

### Phase 1 — x86_64 ISA completeness & correctness — ⬜ NEXT (resume here)
Integer ISA + flags correctness (diff vs golden oracle), SSE→SSE4.2 + **AVX/AVX2**, x87 edge
cases, atomics + ARM weak-memory mapping (x86 TSO → ARM64 barriers), SEH across EC boundary.
Gate: expanded torture/fuzz suite passes vs golden oracle; 3+ non-trivial x64 console programs
(threads+SSE+exceptions) run correct.

### Phase 2 — interpreter → JIT + translation cache — ⬜ pending
### Phase 3 — runtime/Win32 surface (input/audio/DXMT integration) — ⬜ pending
### Phase 4 — green-list bring-up ladder (Hades/Stardew/…) — ⬜ pending
### Phase 5 — hardening / fuzz / regression / CI — ⬜ (continuous from Ph1)

## Milestone protection (do not regress)
Plain x86_64 PE runs end-to-end (run_exit=0) via ARM64EC. Archived:
`archives/milestone-arm64ec-x64-e2e-20260530.tar.gz` (local + external MacRunner-ARCHIVES,
sha ccb34a25…). If any phase risks regressing this, STOP and escalate.
